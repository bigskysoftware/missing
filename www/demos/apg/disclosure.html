  <blockquote>
    <p>
    A disclosure is a widget that enables content to be either collapsed (hidden) or expanded (visible).
    It has two elements: a disclosure button and a section of content whose visibility is controlled by the button.
    When the controlled content is hidden, the button is often styled as a typical push button with a right-pointing arrow or triangle to hint that activating the button will display additional content.
    When the content is visible, the arrow or triangle typically points down.

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>
  Missing.css uses the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element for disclosures.
  Disclosures can be made into an accordion by applying a fixed <code>[name]</code> attribute to each <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element.

  <h2>Keyboard Interaction</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd></kbd>: Activate the disclosure control and toggle visibility of the disclosure content.
  <li><kbd><kbd>Space</kbd></kbd>: Activate the disclosure control and toggle visibility of the disclosure content.
  </ul>
