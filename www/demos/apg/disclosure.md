   A disclosure is a widget that enables content to be either collapsed (hidden) or expanded (visible).
   It has two elements&colon; a disclosure button and a section of content whose visibility is controlled by the button.
   When the controlled content is hidden, the button is often styled as a typical push button with a right-pointing arrow or triangle to hint that activating the button will display additional content.
   When the content is visible, the arrow or triangle typically points down.

## Notes

Missing.css uses the `<details>`{ .language-html } element for disclosures.
Disclosures can be made into an [accordion](/demos/accordion/) by applying a fixed `name`{ .token .attr-name } attribute to each `<details>`{ .language-html } element.


{{ include "demo_kbd.vto" }}
