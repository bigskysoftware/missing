# Changelog

- The following changes are all the work of
  [@geoffrey-eisenbarth@github.com](https://github.com/geoffrey-eisenbarth):

  - Added feed.js, an implementation of ARIA Feed. {.info .color}
  - Fixed: Renaming of `--primary-font` to `--main-font` was incomplete. {.ok .color}
  - Fixed: `--display-font` was documented as being renamed to
    `--secondary-font`, but both variables were actually in use.
    Now, both are documented and used for their respective purposes. {.ok .color}
  - The masquerade class `.<a>` did not work as expected on `<button>`
    elements. {.ok .color}

  Thanks Geoffrey!
- Added a `-dark-theme` class to force-enable the dark theme. Thanks
