# Welcome to missing.css!

Missing.css is a simple CSS library that can be used in many ways â€” you could:

 - Simply drop it into a page and call it a day.
 - Enhance your design with components and utility classes.
 - Create your own look by customizing CSS variables.
 - Write your own CSS on top of it.

Install it on your website if you haven't already:

{{ set version = search.pages("release!=undefined")
    |> map(rel => rel.data.release)
    |> sortSemVer
    |> at(-1) }}

<figure>

  ~~~ html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/missing.css@{{ version }}">
  <!-- Prism theme (https://prismjs.com/): -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/missing.css@{{ version }}/dist/missing-prism.min.css" />
  ~~~

</figure>

You can also install it into an npm project with `npm i -s missing.css`.

This will make your page look a bit like the one you are reading right now,
without applying any classes.

Then, see how you can go beyond classless CSS with its features.

P.S. you can click any class, variable or custom element name in these docs to
jump to its definition. Try it: `.tool-bar`
