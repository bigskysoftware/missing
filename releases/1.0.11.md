## Changelog

 - We're switching entirely to npm for distributing missing.css. Prior versions 
   will be kept on `the.missing.style`, but its use is deprecated and our 
   [release notes pages][] will not link to it. Instead, use one of many npm 
   CDNs ([unpkg][], [jsdelivr][], etc.) or install the package via npm. {.info .bg}
 - If a colored background is applied to an `<aside>` using the `.bg` class, it 
   will have horizontal padding added to prevent the text hitting the edge of 
   the background.
 - Colorways were fiddled with.
 - Fixed: Asides now have vertical margins equal to `--gap`.
